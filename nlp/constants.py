TEXT_1 = "44\nChapter 2 The Role of Judicial Review\nbeing considered, since they may be separated from one of their " \
         "parents and/or uprooted\nfrom their country of citizenship, where they have settled and have " \
         "connections.\nImmigration officers who make H&C decisions are provided with a set of guidelines,\ncontained " \
         "in chapter 9 of the Immigration Manual: Examination and Enforcement. The\nguidelines constitute " \
         "instructions to immigration officers about how to exercise the dis-\ncretion delegated to them. These " \
         "guidelines are also available to the public. A number of\nstatements in the guidelines are relevant to Ms. " \
         "Baker's application. Guideline 9.05 em-\nphasizes that officers have a duty to decide which cases should be " \
         "given a favourable rec-\nommendation, by carefully considering all aspects of the case, using their best " \
         "judgment\nand asking themselves what a reasonable person would do in such a situation. It also\nstates that " \
         "although officers are not expected to \"delve into areas which are not presented\nduring examination or " \
         "interviews, they should attempt to clarify possible humanitarian\ngrounds and public policy considerations " \
         "even if these are not well articulated.\"\nThe guidelines also set out the bases upon which the discretion " \
         "conferred by s. 114(2)\nand the Regulations should be exercised. Two different types of criteria that may " \
         "lead to\na positive s. 114(2) decision are outlined-public policy considerations and humanitar-\nian and " \
         "compassionate grounds. Immigration officers are instructed, under guideline\n9.07, to assure themselves, " \
         "first, whether a public policy consideration is present, and if\nthere is none, whether humanitarian and " \
         "compassionate circumstances exist. Public pol-\nicy reasons include marriage to a Canadian resident, " \
         "the fact that the person has lived in\nCanada, has become established, and has become an “illegal de facto " \
         "resident,\" and the\nfact that the person may be a long-term holder of employment authorization or " \
         "has\nworked as a foreign domestic. Guideline 9.07 states that humanitarian and compassion-\nate grounds " \
         "will exist if \"unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be\ncaused to the person seeking " \
         "consideration if he or she had to leave Canada.” The guide-\nlines also directly address situations " \
         "involving family dependency, and emphasize that\nthe requirement that a person leave Canada to apply from " \
         "abroad may result in hardship\nfor close family members of a Canadian resident, whether parents, children, " \
         "or others\nwho are close to the claimant, but not related by blood. They note that in such cases, " \
         "the\nreasons why the person did not apply from abroad and the existence of family or other\nsupport in the " \
         "person's home country should also be considered.\nC. Procedural Fairness\nThe first ground upon which the " \
         "appellant challenges the decision made by Officer Caden\nis the allegation that she was not accorded " \
         "procedural fairness. She suggests that the fol-\nlowing procedures are required by the duty of fairness " \
         "when parents have Canadian\nchildren and they make an H & C application: an oral interview before the " \
         "decision-\nmaker, notice to her children and the other parent of that interview, a right for the " \
         "chil-\ndren and the other parent to make submissions at that interview, and notice to the other\nparent of " \
         "the interview and of that person's right to have counsel present. She also alleges\nthat procedural " \
         "fairness requires the provision of reasons by the decision-maker, Officer\nCaden, and that the notes of " \
         "Officer Lorenz give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nIn addressing the fairness issues, " \
         "I will consider first the principles relevant to the de-\ntermination of the content of the duty of " \
         "procedural fairness, and then address Ms. Baker's\n "

TEXT_2 = "CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on " \
         "the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped\ninto the book her sister was reading, " \
         "but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice\n'without " \
         "pictures or conversation?'\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for\nthe hot day " \
         "made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the\npleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the " \
         "trouble of\ngetting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit\nwith pink eyes ran close by " \
         "her.\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think\nit so VERY much out of the way to " \
         "hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over\nafterwards, " \
         "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at\nthis, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); " \
         "but when the\nRabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET,\nand looked at it, and then hurried " \
         "on, Alice started to her feet, for\nit flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a " \
         "rabbit\nwith either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and\nburning with curiosity, " \
         "she ran across the field after it, and\nfortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large " \
         "rabbit-hole\nunder the hedge.\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in " \
         "the world she was to get out again.\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, " \
         "and\nthen dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself " \
         "before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.\n "
