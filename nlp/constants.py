         "parents and/or uprooted\nfrom their country of citizenship, where they have settled and have " \
         "connections.\nImmigration officers who make H&C decisions are provided with a set of guidelines,\ncontained " \
         "in chapter 9 of the Immigration Manual: Examination and Enforcement. The\nguidelines constitute " \
         "instructions to immigration officers about how to exercise the dis-\ncretion delegated to them. These " \
         "guidelines are also available to the public. A number of\nstatements in the guidelines are relevant to Ms. " \
         "Baker's application. Guideline 9.05 em-\nphasizes that officers have a duty to decide which cases should be " \
         "given a favourable rec-\nommendation, by carefully considering all aspects of the case, using their best " \
         "judgment\nand asking themselves what a reasonable person would do in such a situation. It also\nstates that " \
         "although officers are not expected to \"delve into areas which are not presented\nduring examination or " \
         "interviews, they should attempt to clarify possible humanitarian\ngrounds and public policy considerations " \
         "even if these are not well articulated.\"\nThe guidelines also set out the bases upon which the discretion " \
         "conferred by s. 114(2)\nand the Regulations should be exercised. Two different types of criteria that may " \
         "lead to\na positive s. 114(2) decision are outlined-public policy considerations and humanitar-\nian and " \
         "compassionate grounds. Immigration officers are instructed, under guideline\n9.07, to assure themselves, " \
         "first, whether a public policy consideration is present, and if\nthere is none, whether humanitarian and " \
         "compassionate circumstances exist. Public pol-\nicy reasons include marriage to a Canadian resident, " \
         "the fact that the person has lived in\nCanada, has become established, and has become an “illegal de facto " \
         "resident,\" and the\nfact that the person may be a long-term holder of employment authorization or " \
         "has\nworked as a foreign domestic. Guideline 9.07 states that humanitarian and compassion-\nate grounds " \
         "will exist if \"unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be\ncaused to the person seeking " \
         "consideration if he or she had to leave Canada.” The guide-\nlines also directly address situations " \
         "involving family dependency, and emphasize that\nthe requirement that a person leave Canada to apply from " \
         "abroad may result in hardship\nfor close family members of a Canadian resident, whether parents, children, " \
         "or others\nwho are close to the claimant, but not related by blood. They note that in such cases, " \
         "the\nreasons why the person did not apply from abroad and the existence of family or other\nsupport in the " \
         "person's home country should also be considered.\nC. Procedural Fairness\nThe first ground upon which the " \
         "appellant challenges the decision made by Officer Caden\nis the allegation that she was not accorded " \
         "procedural fairness. She suggests that the fol-\nlowing procedures are required by the duty of fairness " \
         "when parents have Canadian\nchildren and they make an H & C application: an oral interview before the " \
         "decision-\nmaker, notice to her children and the other parent of that interview, a right for the " \
         "chil-\ndren and the other parent to make submissions at that interview, and notice to the other\nparent of " \
         "the interview and of that person's right to have counsel present. She also alleges\nthat procedural " \
         "fairness requires the provision of reasons by the decision-maker, Officer\nCaden, and that the notes of " \
         "Officer Lorenz give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nIn addressing the fairness issues, " \
         "I will consider first the principles relevant to the de-\ntermination of the content of the duty of " \
         "procedural fairness, and then address Ms. Baker's\n "

         "but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice\n'without " \

TEXT_5 = "An apéritif is an alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite, " \
         "and is therefore usually dry rather than sweet. Common choices for an apéritif are vermouth; champagne; " \
         "pastis; gin; arak; rakı; fino, amontillado or other styles of dry sherry (but not usually cream or oloroso " \
         "blended sherry, which is very sweet and rich); and any still, dry, light white wine. An apéritif may be " \
         "served with an hors d'oeuvre or amuse-bouche, such as crackers, cheese, pâté, quiche or olives. Apéritif is " \
         "a French word derived from the Latin verb aperire, which means \"to open\". The French colloquial word for " \
         "apéritif is apéro. The 5th-century Christian ascetic Diadochos of Photiki says, \"People who wish to " \
         "discipline the sexual organs should avoid drinking those artificial concoctions which are called " \
         "'aperitifs'—presumably because they open a way to the stomach for the vast meal which is to follow.\" This " \
         "means that apéritifs have existed since at least the 5th century. In 1796, Turin distiller Antonio Carpano " \
         "invented modern vermouth. The apéritif was introduced in France in 1846 when a French chemist, " \
         "Joseph Dubonnet, created his eponymous wine-based drink as a means of delivering malaria-fighting quinine. " \
         "The medicine was a bitter brew, so he developed a formula of herbs and spices to mask quinine's sharp " \
         "flavor, and it worked so well that the recipe has remained well-guarded ever since. French Foreign Legion " \
         "soldiers made use of it in mosquito-infested Northern Africa. Dubonnet's wife was so fond of the drink that " \
         "she had all her friends try it, and its popularity spread. Five glasses of apéritif and mixed nuts. " \
         "Apéritifs were already widespread in the 19th century in Italy, where they were being served in fashionable " \
         "cafés in Turin (where they were born), Rome, Genoa, Florence, Milan and Venice. Apéritifs became very " \
         "popular in Europe in the late 19th century. The popularity in Europe crossed the Atlantic and by 1900, " \
         "they were also commonly served in the United States. The apéritif recrossed the Atlantic in the 1970s: the " \
         "habit of a substantial food offering with the purchase of a drink during \"Happy Hour\" in the United " \
         "States pushed the development of a more food-heavy apéritif in Italy as well. In Spain and in some " \
         "countries of Latin America, apéritifs have been a staple of tapas for centuries. There is no single " \
         "alcoholic drink that is always served as an apéritif. Fortified wine, liqueur, and dry champagne are " \
         "probably the most common choices. Because it is served before dining, the emphasis is usually on dry rather " \
         "than sweet, as a general guideline. In France, the apéritif varies from region to region: pastis is popular " \
         "in the south of France, Calvados brandy in the Normandy region, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. " \
         "Champagne wine or Cognac may also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and very popular " \
         "apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine " \
         "like bourgogne aligoté. The word Kir Royal is used when white wine is replaced with a Champagne wine. A " \
         "simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by " \
         "amuse-bouches. In Italy, vermouth or wine may be served as the apéritif (called aperitivo). Martini, " \
         "Aperol Spritz and Campari with soda are also popular aperitivo drinks of choice. In Greece, " \
         "ouzo is a popular choice, except on Crete, where it is very common to take some Tsikoudia (raki) after a " \
         "meal. In the Eastern Mediterranean, arak is served with meze. In Britain and Ireland sherry and dry madeira " \
         "are traditional apéritifs. A digestif is an alcoholic beverage served after a meal, to aid digestion. When " \
         "served after a coffee course, it may be called pousse-café. Digestifs are usually taken neat. Common kinds " \
         "of digestif include: Brandy (Cognac, Armagnac, alembic-made), Chacha, Eaux de vie (fruit brandies, " \
         "Schnapps, Calvados), Pomace brandy (grappa), Tsikoudia, Fortified wines (sweet sherry (usually cream or " \
         "oloroso sherry), vermouth, port, madeira, and Ratafia), Liqueurs bitter or sweet (Drambuie, Amaretto, " \
         "Bénédictine, amari (such as fernet), herbal liqueur, Sambuca, Chartreuse, Grand Marnier, Jägermeister, " \
         "Irish Mist, Kahlúa, limoncello, Herbs de Majorca, Beirão, Unicum, Underberg, Fernet-Branca, Mirto, Malort), " \
         "Distilled liquors (ouzo, schnapps, tequila or akvavit) Liquor cocktails (Black Russian, Rusty Nail, etc.), " \
         "Bitter digestifs typically contain carminative herbs, which are thought to aid digestion. In many " \
         "countries, people drink alcoholic beverages at lunch and dinner. Studies have found that when food is eaten " \
         "before drinking alcohol, alcohol absorption is reduced and the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the " \
         "blood is increased. The mechanism for the faster alcohol elimination appears to be unrelated to the type of " \
         "food. The mechanism is likely food-induced, which increases in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and liver blood " \
         "flow."
